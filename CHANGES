The following updates have been made to Warrick:

- 2006-02-02   Fixed bug allowing Warrick to gracefully 
               try other stored URLs when broken ones
               exist.

- 2006-02-02   Added check for URLs that have multiple 
               slashes.  I just drop all multiple slashes.
               Example: http://foo.org//a?b//c ->
                        http://foo.org/a?b//c

- 2006-01-20   Allows new style Google cache headers to
               be properly parsed for date.

- 2006-02-20   Changed Google cache requests to use Google
               API (which requires user to get a Google key).
               Google license key can be stored in a file
               google_key.txt or passed in as a command line
               argument --google-key.  Warrick now uses
               lister queries by default to get cached URLs.
               
- 2006-02-28   Made make_http_request more robust by sleeping
               after receiving an http 500 response (sometimes
               IA does this).
               
- 2006-03-01   Implemented feature to stop Warrick from running
               in a controled way by using a stop file.
               
- 2006-04-17   Changed code looking for Google's Next button
               per a change that Google made sometime in Apr.

- 2006-04-29   Fixed bug which didn't allow hyphens in the 
               domain name of the starting URL.
               
- 2006-04-29   Improved Google "site:" queries to match URLs
               that are missing the 'www.' prefix.
               
- 2006-04-30   Improved documentation produced by -help.

- 2006-05-24   Fixed bug that caused binary files in Windows to
               have a carriage return (%OD) inserted at every
               occurance of a line feed (%OA) character.  This
               caused images to look garbled.
          
- 2006-06-06   Fixed problem saving files in Windows that 
               contain '?' and other characters in them.
               
- 2006-06-07   Version 1.3.6.  Made Warrick try 5 times to get 
               list of archived URLs from IA when they have 
               temporary problems.
               
- 2006-06-16   Version 1.4.  Improved handling of -v and -k 
               options.  Removed LOG from each print statment and
               just redirected STDOUT to print to LOG.  Fixed
               possible bug when storing files to Windows.               

- 2006-06-19   Version 1.4.1.  Fixed bug to make changes in
               Windows file names to be reflected in links to
               those files.

- 2006-06-26   Version 1.5.  Added option to limit the date range
               of resources to be downloaded from IA.
              
- 2006-07-10   Version 1.5.1.  Fixed bug that made IA only read
               first set of results for lister queries due to 
               date range changes introduced in 1.5.
               
- 2006-07-22   Version 1.5.2.  Numerous modifications/fixes:
               1) Make Warrick save http://foo.org/bar?a/b/
                  as foo.org/bar?a_b_ instead of 
                  foo.org/bar?a_b_index.html
               2) Remove sleep when no HTTP GET request is 
                  made between resource recoveries
               3) Don't recover starting URL twice when using
                  complete recovery option
               4) Redirect STDERR to STDOUT
               5) Delay between Yahoo API calls when receiving
                  an API error and warn the user
               6) Modify Google cache storage so it doesn't
                  automatically remove index.html from the end
                  of a URL that was page-scraped.
               7) Fix scrape for Google's Next button.
               8) Terminate Google looping when getting back
                  Supplemental Results
               9) TODO: Fix scrape for Google Images
               
- 2006-07-24   Version 1.5.3.  Fixed queries for Google images
               so it now can properly read the JavaScript results
               produced by lister queries.
               
- 2006-07-27   Version 1.5.4.  Added ability to just specify a
               single year for accessing IA resources.  This
               speeds up lister queries.

- 2006-08-10   Version 1.5.5.  Added ability to just specify a 
               single day for accessing IA resources.  Fixed a
               new problem with Yahoo which has started changing
               FRAME tags so Yahoo is the least favored when
               recovering frameset pages.  Added code to remove
               common session IDs from links.
               
- 2006-08-19   Version 1.5.6.  Serveral fixes/improvements:
               1) Fixed bug where getting a Google document is
                  wrong when lister queries don't find all cached
                  resources.
               2) Only query IA for URLs ending in '/', '.htm',
                  '.html', '.shtml', '.asp', '.jsp', '.php' after 
                  querying search engines.  
               3) When recovering a URL that may point to a 
                  directory, search the frontier, seen, and 
                  cached URLs first to verify.
               4) Allow multiple Google keys to be used.
               5) Allow user to specify max daily queries for 
                  repos.
               6) Added check for 403 (robots.txt blocks access) 
                  responses from IA.
               7) Lower-cased URLs if option is supplied before
                  storing in Cached_urls.
                  
- 2006-08-23   Version 1.6.0.  Converted $url->path to $url->epath
               so URLs with %2F don't cause Warrick to terminate.
               Fixed logic when no SEs have an HTML resources (IA 
               was not getting queried).  Fixed several places
               where ignore case option was not being considered.
               
- 2006-08-29   Version 1.6.1.  
               1) Changed MSN API key since MSN suddenly started 
                  rejecting the previous key.  
               2) Added -gl (google-live) switch so cached pages 
                  could be obtained from the public web interface 
                  instead of using the API which is working from 
                  an older and smaller repository.  
               3) Started dumping URLs that remain in the frontier 
                  out to the log file.
               4) Allowed initial root URL to contain a file
                  instead of just a directory when doing recursive
                  reconstructions.  So http://foo.org/welcome.html
                  is now acceptable instead of just http://foo.org.

- 2006-10-02   Version 1.6.2
               1) Allowed Google queries to keep asking for more
                  if 100 results were returned and Next button 
                  wasn't found.
               2) Replaced SimpleLinkExtor for link extraction with
                  my own custom link extractor that grabs URLs in 
                  redirect meta tags.
               3) Added logic to look for more than 250 results from
                  MSN in anticipation that eventually they'll return
                  1000 results like they are now doing from their WI.
               4) Started logging repos where we find cached results
                  that are not recovered.
 
- 2006-10-07   Version 1.6.3
               1) Fixed bug with -v option.  The '?' char in 
                  recovered files is replaced with '-' so the
                  file loads in the browser by default.
               2) Added test to see if IA is having technical
                  problems.

- 2007-02-02   Version 1.7.0
               1) Fixed Google page scraping code to read past the
                  first page of results.
               2) Made Warrick go back to WUI access for cached
                  pages since Google is no longer giving out API 
                  keys for their SOAP API.
               3) Improved the URL normalization routine.
               4) Created separate classes for each web repository.
                  Moved much of the repository-specific code into
                  the classes to reduce the size and complexity of
                  warrick.pl.
               5) Yahoo Images appears to have a problem when using
                  the "site" parameter which means Warrick will not
                  see any images from Yahoo lister queries.  I've
                  notified the Yahoo API email list about the 
                  problem and supposedly it's going to be fixed.

- 2007-03-23   Version 1.7.1
               1) Added debug output of how many URLs have been
                  recovered so far.
               2) Handled special situation where IA has the same
                  URL indexed (by our normalization rules) at more
                  than one location.  Example: www.foo.org and
                  foo.org.
                  
- 2007-04-09   Version 1.7.2
               1) Added --proxy switch to indicate a proxy server
                  is being used.
               2) Made Warrick self-regulate daily queries between
                  invocations (ie, Warrick will remember how many
                  queries it made the last time it ran so it won't
                  accidentally use too many queries in the same 24
                  hour period).
 
- 2007-04-23   Version 1.7.3
               1) Added tests for bad characters in the domain 
                  name when parsing a URL.
               2) Added check for missing cached URL from MSN.
               
- 2007-07-28   Version 1.7.4
               1) Applied fix to the regex: /^$Limit_dir/ which must 
                  be escaped. -Thanks to Stas Bekman for this fix.
               2) Changed all occurances of MSN to Live Search. This
                  means 'm' parameter is now 'ls'.
               3) Corrected error with Google repo not reseting all
                  keys back to 0 used queries when maxed-out.   
               4) Improved ability to stop Warrick gracefully in mid
                  recovery when it detects a terminate early file.    
               5) Initial lister queries are used to determine if the
                  starting URL should be terminated with a slash.           
               6) Added Tron-like saying, "End of Line", when Warrick
                  completes, mainly for use by the on-line user 
                  interface.
                  
- 2009-05-11   Version 1.7.7
               1) Fixed regexp looking for Google & Live's
                  cache timestamp and to remove headers.
               2) Allowed Warrick to give up when getting 403
                  response from Yahoo.
                
- 2009-05-19   Version 1.7.8
               1) Changed how Warrick accessed Yahoo's cache (they
                  now require one access to the frames page and a 
                  second access to the actual page).

- 2009-06-22   Version 1.7.9
               1) Made sure call to Yahoo for frames page did not
                  happen if an image was being accessed.

- 2010-01-06   Version 1.8
	       1) Improved robustness against flaky Yahoo cache.
               2) Added -input-file option. (by James Young)
               3) Formatted help to fit 80 columns. (James Young)
               4) Removed Google API key options since it is no
                  longer supported by Google.
               5) Cleaned out Yahoo-added HTML from cached pages.

- 2010-07-05   Version 1.8.1
               1) Fixed 404 error with Internet Archive
               2) Removed SOAP::Lite requirement since Google API
                  is no longer used.
